# CodeStream

The best place to talk about source code is in the source code. CodeStream is chat for your code built right into the IDE. As you identify portions of your code to talk about with the other collaborators in your project, the conversations persist with the code as it changes over time. As we like to say, _Better Teamwork, Better Code!_

CodeStream is coming to VS Code very soon!

Sign-up for updates and more information at https://codestream.com/

Feel free to contact us via e-mail at team@codestream.com as well if you have any questions.

## Features

* Selected portions of your code become a first-class object to talk about in the conversation.
* Each file has its own conversation stream.
* Automatically detects the collaborators on the git project to make adding them simple.
* Posts can be e-mailed out for those not yet using CodeStream. Collaboorators can reply to the emails and the reply will appear as a post.
* Much, much, more....

## Requirements

CodeStream only supports projects managed with **git** at this time.  Other VCS's are coming soon.
